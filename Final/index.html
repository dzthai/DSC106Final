            <b>Description</b>: This graph is asking which is the best North American team during this time frame. It
            uses number of
            kills combined for each team as a measure of skill, with OpTic Gaming as the clear winner.
            <br><b>Color choice</b>: #ff4654 because it is the color Riot Games uses for their Valorant themed pages and
            logos.
